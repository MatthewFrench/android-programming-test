# Vault Innovation Android Interview Test

Thanks for applying at Vault!

The tests in this exercise shouldn't take more than a hour or so to complete.

## Instructions

Please make the tests in app/src/androidTest/java/com/vaultinnovation/androidcodetest all pass.
To get started, fork the repository and make a feature branch for your answers.
Once you're done, create a pull request with your answers.

Modify MainActivity and TextActivity to make the tests pass. You may create any additional classes
or other files you need to perform this task. When complete, the app should have the following
functionality:

1. The title textview should say "One side makes you larger" in landscape orientation
   and "The other side makes you small" in portrait orientation.
2. Tapping the button should add the text entered into the edittext to the listview.
3. The listview items should always be sorted in alphabetical order.
4. Tapping a listview item should open TextActivity and display the selected item

You may modify ActivityTest and the layout xml if you feel it is helpful, but doing this will not be
required to finish the test.
